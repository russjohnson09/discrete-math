Define the binary relation $\sim$ on $\mathbb{Z}$ by: for all integers $a$ and $b$, $a\sim b$ if and only if $2a+3b$ is a multiple of 5. We will show that the relation $\sim$ on $\mathbb{Z}$ is an equivalence relation. This means that the binary realtion $~$ on $\mathbb{Z}$ is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. We will prove that $~$ satisfies these properties on $\mathbb{Z}$ in this order.

\begin{proof}
Let $a$ be an arbitrary integer. The set of integers is a ring and so from the distributive property of multiplication over addition,
\begin{align*}
2a+3a &= (2+3)a \\
&= 5a.
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}
Let $a$ and $b$ be arbitrary integers where there exists an integer $k$ such that
\begin{equation}\label{1}
2a + 3b = 5k.
\end{equation}
Subtracting $5b$ from both sides of \eqref{1},
\begin{equation}
2a - 2b = 5k - 5b.
\end{equation}
\end{proof}

We know that $5a$ is an integer from the closure property of multiplication on the set integers. From the definition of multiples, the integer $5a$ is a multiple of 5. We have therefore shown that for an arbitrary integer $a$, $a\sim a$. This implies that the binary relatiion

For some background information I have been reading {\it Contemporary Abstract Algebra} by Gallian.  Aside from this, I did not use any other source.
