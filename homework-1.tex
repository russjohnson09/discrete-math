We were asked to prove the following theorem.
\begin{thm}\label{thm:1}
If $R$ is any commutative ring with identity $1_R$, then no element of $R$ is both a unit and a zero
divisor.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
We will prove Theorem \ref{thm:1} by contradiction. Therefore, we assume, to the contrary, that there exists some commutative ring $R$ with identity $ 1_R $ such that there exists some element $a$ in $R$ that is both a unit and a zero divisor. We will show that this leads to a contradiction.

Because $a$ is a unit, we know from the definition of a unit that there exists some element $u$ in $R$ such that 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:1}
ua = 1_R.
\end{equation}
Because $a$ is a zero divisor, we know from the definition of a zero divisor that there exists some 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:1.1}
b\neq 0_R 
\end{equation}
in $R$ such that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:2}
ab=0_R.
\end{equation}
Multiplying by $u$ on the left side of equation \eqref{eq:2}, we obtain
\begin{equation}\label{eq:3}
u(ab) = u0_R.
\end{equation}
According to Theorem 30, for any ring and any element of that ring multiplied by that ring's additive identity will be equal to the ring's additive identity.  Because $R$ is a ring, $a$ is an element of this ring, and $0_R$ is the additive identity of $R$, the following is true
\begin{equation}\label{eq:4}
u0_R = 0_R.
\end{equation}
Using \eqref{eq:4} for substitution in \eqref{eq:3}, we obtain
\begin{equation}\label{eq:5}
u(ab) = 0_R.
\end{equation}
Applying the Associative Property of Multiplication to \eqref{eq:5}, we obtain
\begin{equation}\label{eq:6}
(ua)b = 0_R.
\end{equation}
Using \eqref{eq:1} for substitution in \eqref{eq:6}, we obtain
\begin{equation}\label{eq:7}
1_R b = 0_R
\end{equation}
Applying the Multiplicative Identity Property to \eqref{eq:7}, we obtain
\begin{equation}\label{eq:8}
b = 0_R. 
\end{equation}
From \eqref{eq:1.1} and \eqref{eq:8} we arrive at a contradiction.  Therefore, $a$ cannot be both a unit and a zero divisor.

In conclusion, we have shown that if $R$ is any commutative ring with identity $1_R$, then no element of $R$ is both a unit and a zero divisor.
\end{proof}

For some background information I have been reading {\it Contemporary Abstract Algebra} by Gallian.  Aside from this, I did not use any other source.
